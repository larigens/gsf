                    <p className=" mb-4 text-justify fs-22">Running a business comes with its fair share of challenges, and managing cash flow can often be a daunting task. That's where factoring steps in as a powerful financial solution.</p>
                    <h3 className="secondary-color mb-3 fs-22 fw-bold"> What is Factoring?</h3>
                    <p className="mb-4 text-justify fs-18">Factoring, also known as accounts receivable financing, is a flexible and efficient way for businesses to secure immediate access to their outstanding invoices. Instead of waiting for customers to pay, you can convert your accounts receivable into working capital, helping you meet ongoing operational needs, seize growth opportunities, and maintain a healthy financial position.</p>
